# fenz.io
This is the repo for my personal website over at [fenz.io](https://fenz.io).

You can run this locally this by downloading this repo and running
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You won't see any blog posts, because my personal access token to contentful is not in the repo.

For a description of the stack and my [inspiration](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage), have a look at my [blog post](https://www.fenz.io/blog/posts/hello-world)
