My personal website

## Intro
This is my personal webpage. It is still under construction.
Index.html is going to be the landing page, and it will probably continue to be a static HTML file.
I plan on doing a blog, which is either going to be done with Angular (or React) or it is going to be server side rendered (next.js or something like that).

## TODO

- [x] Basic layout/design
- [x] Basic responsiveness features
- [ ] Fill landing page with content
- [ ] Contact form on landing page
- [ ] Site notice page
- [ ] L10N for German
- [x] Register service worker
- [ ] Add manifest
- [ ] Add custom background image
- [ ] Add blog (oof)
- [ ] Convert blog to PWA (double oof)
