My personal website

## Intro
This is my personal webpage. It is still under construction.
Index.html is going to be the landing page, and it will probably continue to be a static HTML file.
I plan on doing a blog, which is either going to be done with Angular (or React) or it is going to be server side rendered (next.js or something like that).

## Displaying the page
For the time being the page is not hosted anywhere.
To run it locally, you can either:
- run 'npm install' and 'npm run dev-server' or
- copy everything in the folder 'static' into the directory where 'index.html' is located
